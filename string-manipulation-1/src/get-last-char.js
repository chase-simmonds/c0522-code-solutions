/* Declaring a function getlastchar passing one parameter string. The goal is to
get the last letter of any stirng it passes through. Then use a methdod charAt
that targets the string length. The string length needs to be subtracted by one
to account for the first character being located at 0. Thus returning the
last character of a string. */
